# Principia
This is the homepage of the project Principia

## Description
Principia is a formula database with (hopefully) and embedded solver intended to
streamline the study process for Mathematically-based courses.

---
## TODO
### Add Groups
### Streamline formula-solver appearance
Use partials, for example, the partial for the nav bar is
```
<% include ../partials/navbar %>
```
Use it as an example if you want to create more partials.
### Add more features to the user profile
### Give admins a good management interface
### Give users options to customize their profile, change pwd, etc.
